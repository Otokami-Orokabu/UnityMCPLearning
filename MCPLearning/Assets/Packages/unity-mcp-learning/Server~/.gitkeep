# Server~ Directory Placeholder (main branch)
# 
# This directory is kept empty on main branch for lightweight distribution.
# GitHub Actions will populate it with built MCP server files when needed.
# For development with Server~ contents, use the 'development' branch.
#
# Runtime: MCPServerManager will run npm install to generate dependencies.
